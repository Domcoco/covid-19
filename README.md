# Hacking Health Covid-19

www.covid.skemagloballab.io

## Context

In these trying times for people across the world, we feel fortunate to have access to the Internet, and to be - relatively - able to pursue our mission thanks to our technologies. As a research lab, the SKEMA Global Lab in AI is also fortunate to have access to a platform dedicated to research in Data Science.

In the world context, on top of its normal operations, the Lab's team has decided to devote some resources to open its platform, both in terms of technology and human resources, to contribute to the world conversation about Covid-19. SKEMA' students who are interested in contributing to thi initiative are very welcome. The goal is to make a contribution to the world conversation with science at its core.

For this initiative, we want to be as **open** as possible in this initiative. We want to build on **open data**, **open code**, **open research**, and **open source software** as much as possible. Why? Because we want to ensure our results are at the highest level possible of **reproducibility** in order to allow anyone on the planet to be able to replicate, validate and augment our potential contributions.

This initiative is not an official initiative from SKEMA, it is just a **pilot program** in the current context. To help federate our student body, we call it **Hacking Health Covid-19**. Since it is just an initiative from the SKEMA Global Lab in AI, it does not provide any credit to students. The good news is: no credit, no pressure. We believe the impact on our communities is a big enough motivation.

At the end of the period, a committee will decide on the 3 best contributions to this initiative. Three teams will be rewarded with an honorific prize, which will be announced on June 15, 2020.

Once the overall initiative is organized around a website / dashboard accessible to the public, we will consider potential outputs such as this one [https://fr.unesco.org/events/hackaton-codethecurve](https://fr.unesco.org/events/hackaton-codethecurve){target="_blank"}

## Description

This **Hacking Health Covid-19** has similarities with hackathons and also one main difference: it is similar since it requires **a strong involvement** on a short period of time to create a viable contribution, and it is also different in the sense that it spans **over a 6-week period**. It starts on April 7 and ends on May 18, 2020. The fact that it lasts 6 weeks mean that teams will be able to enter at any point of time and can finish before May the 18th. Teams jump in and out when they want during this period.

Starting on April 7th and finishing late May, our Lab team will assemble the different contributions into our overall Hacking Health Covid-19 dashboard. Participants and the public will be able to see the dashboard in construction on our Hacking Health Covid-19's website.

To participate, students need to form teams of 3 people. In order to cover the whole range from web apps development to statistics and machine learning, we will R. Coding knowledge in R is thus advisable. Now, team members can have different level. Teams will have access to online peer learning sessions on our communication platform and on our virtual campus. They will be able to train themselves on the fundamentals of R.

Teams must designate a team leader and fill up this form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdomp_8h3o1gvGGdRJVFpvsKzXJsnpOK7Pjo65VJprHaCOQDg/viewform?usp=sf_link){target="_blank"}

## Objectives

We are starting to see a lot of online initiatives about Covid-19, and notably about data visualizations. Even if they are numerous, they tend to be very close to each other. And although visualizations are important for our own dashboard, we can augment them with some data science perspectives, for instance in terms of sentiment analysis, or predictive modelling.

An exemple of great visualizations is [https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data){target="_blank"}.

Our main objective is to provide a scientific perspective to the world conversation and to open up our contribution so that other people can leverage it.

By providing a scientific perspective, we mean to propose contributions that can be validated by others, and shedding a slightly different light to the pandemic. A Github repo has been created to host the code and serves also as a data warehouse, which can be found [here](https://github.com/warint){target="_blank"}.


## Mission

This **Hacking Health Covid-19** initiative just wants to be a positive use of our time and resources to potentially help communities around us or around the world.

## Tools

You will find some of the tools we will use here: [www.quantumstudio.skemagloballab.io](https://quantumstudio.skemagloballab.io){target="_blank"}:

- first, our main portal: [www.skemagloballab.io](https://www.skemagloballab.io){target="_blank}
- The **Open Knowlege Base**: an open source version of Slack, we will communicate **exclusively** through this platform. Our whole team will be here for you. You need to create your account. Any person with a skema.edu email address can create an account.
- The **Virtual Campus**: a set of reference courses that you will use during your *peer learning sessions*.
- **Quantum Studio Core**: the computing platform. We will provide you with your credentials by email before class. It will be useful for your R-based initiative.
- Our [cloud.skemagloballab.io](https://cloud.skemagloballab.io){target="_blank"}: you will have access to an open source version of Dropbox where you will put your working documents.
- A **Github** folder to coodinate your work with your teammates. We will provide you with our git address.


## Timeline / Gantt

This **Hacking Health Covid-19** starts on April 7 and ends on May 18, 2020. It is a jump in jump out process. Teams will be able to join late April, or to propose their contribution before May 18. The end date is just the ultimate date when our Lab team will stop accepting new contributions.

### Meetings

Meetings will be organized every week during the period spanning from April 7th to May 18th:

- Tuesday April 14, 2020, 2:30 PM - 5:30 PM [limited number of seats]
